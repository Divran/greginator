				<li><div class="alert alert-info">This is the most important part of the setup, as it allows the <em>blocking mode</em> setting to work in your interface, which is required to be able to encode more than one recipe in a single assembly line.</div></li>
				<li>You will notice that the topmost item p2p appears to be pointing at the 'wrong' side of the first input bus. This is intentional. We know the item p2p will not be able to put any items into the input bus from this side, but it can still see into it, and that is enough for blocking mode to work. As long as the interface sees that an item is already inside, it won't try to push the next requested craft in.</li>
				<li>I recommend you use an interface p2p rather than a normal interface to allow multiple assembly lines to easily reuse the same recipes.</li>

			<p>Finish up the assembling line multiblock.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I recommend you do this using the auto-build feature of a Multiblock Hologram Structure Projector. Grab 15 of them in a stack, then grab all required materials, minus the buses and hatches which you already placed. Then temporarily put any wireless ME terminal which you may have in your inventory into a backpack or a chest. This way, the holo projector won't use any buses or hatches you may have in your ME storage. Then shift-right click to complete the multiblock.</li>

				<strong>36 recipe slots isn't enough! How do you get more?</strong>
				<br/> I recommend a quick research trip into thaumcraft to unlock transvector interfaces. Then place them near the item p2p as shown in this picture, and link them all to the item p2p input.

			<h4>Step 11</h4>
			<p>One assembly line isn't anywhere near fast enough. You should be looking forward to setting up something similar to this, eventually.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be careful when building many assembly lines in the same chunk. Too many will overload the chunk and minecraft will no longer be able to save that chunk, causing rollbacks. I believe we are very close to hitting that limit in the picture to the left, so I <strong>don't</strong> recommend building your assembling lines on two floors. Stick to one floor.</li>
